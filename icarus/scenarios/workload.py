    Parameters
    ----------
    topology : fnss.Topology
        The topology to which the workload refers
    n_contents : int
        The number of content object
    alpha : float
        The Zipf alpha parameter
    rate : float
        The mean rate of requests per second
    n_warmup : int
        The number of warmup requests (i.e. requests executed to fill cache but
        not logged)
    n_measured : int
        The number of logged requests after the warmup
    
    Returns
    -------
    events : iterator
        Iterator of events. Each event is a 2-tuple where the first element is
        the timestamp at which the event occurs and the second element is a
        dictionary of event attributes.
